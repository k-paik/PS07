## Modified this header

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Example Code with ggplot2

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
cars <- cars %>% 
  mutate(origin = ifelse((speed*dist >= 300), "Canada", "Mexico")) %>% 
  mutate(year_recorded = 1920)
summary(cars)
glimpse(cars)
```

## Example Plot

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(pressure, aes(x = temperature, y = pressure)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Pressure vs. temperature")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
